# Bacteria Simulation Project

## Overview
This project simulates the behavior and evolution of bacteria in a virtual environment. The simulation includes various parameters and traits that influence the behavior and survival of the bacteria.

## Features
- **Simulation Environment:** Provides a virtual environment where bacteria can live, move, and interact with each other.
- **Genetic Traits:** Bacteria have genetic traits such as tendrils, absorption capacity, membrane strength, and photosynthesis, which influence their behavior and survival.
- **Dynamic Environment:** The simulation includes dynamic factors such as sunlight availability and random events that affect the bacteria population.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Tracks various metrics over time, such as population count, deaths, average lifespan, and average genetic traits, providing insights into the behavior and adaptations of the bacteria population.

## Getting Started
To run the simulation locally, follow these steps:

1. Install necessary libraries:
   ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
